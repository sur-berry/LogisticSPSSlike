Description: This package provides a streamlined process for generating logistic regression tables in R that closely resemble the output format commonly seen in SPSS software. It is designed for users transitioning from SPSS to R who wish to retain familiarity with the logistic regression output terminology. Key features include the calculation of B values (log-odds coefficients) accessible via 'coef(fit)', Odds Ratios (OR) as exponentiated B values obtained through 'exp(coef(fit))', 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for the OR derived from 'exp(confint(fit))', p-values from the summary of the model fit, and Wald statistics computed as the square of the Z values. The package ensures that variable names are consistent with those used in SPSS to reduce confusion and improve workflow efficiency for users accustomed to SPSS outputs.
